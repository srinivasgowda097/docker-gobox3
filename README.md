# docker-gobox3
a sample go docker image build for a Go application

## Application
[My Revel App On Github](https://github.com/claytantor/myrevelapp)

## Purpose
More and more enterprises are using docker. In terms of POCs it may be a way to get enterprises running your app quickly. I really just wanted to see what it would take to build an application container that would start up and run with zero startup config. In the future I could see an application that would start up and ask questions to configure itself.
